*** Comments ***
This test validates eCAL communication in a scenario involving multiple publishers and subscribers.

Test Setup:
- Two publishers run in parallel and publish messages on the **same topic**.
  • Publisher 1 sends messages containing the byte value **42**.
  • Publisher 2 sends messages containing the byte value **43**.
- Two subscribers listen on that same topic and must receive all messages from both publishers.

Covered eCAL modes:
- local_shm
- local_udp
- (local_tcp) --> Failing
- network_udp
- network_tcp

Goals:
- Ensure that eCAL correctly distributes messages from **multiple sources** to **multiple receivers**.
- Verify that **topic routing, message integrity, and delivery** work consistently across different transport modes.

Success Criteria:
- Each subscriber must receive **10 messages with value 42** and **10 with value 43**.
- If this condition is met, the subscriber exits with code **0**.
- If any expected messages are missing, the subscriber exits with code **1**.

# DISABLED: local_tcp mode fails when multiple publishers send on the same topic concurrently in one container.
# In this setup, TCP connections on 127.0.0.1 suffer from race conditions or internal routing conflicts.
# Not all messages are received due to internal eCAL limitations in TCP local mode.
# Use network_tcp or other transport modes for reliable multi-pub/sub tests.
