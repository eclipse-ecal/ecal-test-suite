## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to provide:

* Automated test runs on push, pull request, or schedule
* Reliable feedback on message communication and process stability
* Visual test reports for easy inspection

## Features

* Supports multiple eCAL transport layers (SHM, UDP, TCP)
* Covers common scenarios such as:

  * Publisher to Subscriber communication
  * Multi-publisher and multi-subscriber setups
  * Fault injection (e.g., crashing subscribers or publishers)
  * Network failure simulations
* Test results are published to GitHub Pages
* Integration in eCAL repositori via `repository_dispatch`

## Test Scenarios

Each test case is implemented using [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/), with Docker-based isolation.

## Test Reports

Test results are automatically deployed to:
ðŸ‘‰ [https://eclipse-ecal.github.io/ecal-test-suite/](https://eclipse-ecal.github.io/ecal-test-suite/)

Each run is timestamped and archived, with access to:

* `log.html`
* `report.html`
* `output.xml`

## Triggering Tests

Tests can be triggered in three ways:

1. Manually via GitHub Actions
2. Automatically from the eCAL repository using `repository_dispatch` (Create a PR or Push to Master)

## Note for Forks and GitHub Token Setup

When working with a **forked repository** (e.g. `YourUsername/ecal`), GitHub Actions cannot trigger workflows in other repositories (like the test suite) unless explicitly allowed via a token.

To enable integration testing across forks, two GitHub tokens are required:

### 1. `TEST_SUITE_TOKEN`

**Used in:** your fork of `ecal` (e.g. `YourUsername/ecal`)

**Purpose:**  
Triggers the test suite (e.g. `YourUsername/ecal-test-suite`) via `repository_dispatch` when a PR or push occurs in your forked ecal repo.

**Type:**  
Classic Personal Access Token (PAT)_  
--> Fine-grained tokens **do not work here** (tested and confirmed)

**Required Scopes:**

- `repo` (for private repositories)  
- `workflow`

**How to set up:**

1. Go to [Developer Settings â†’ Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Name it: `TEST_SUITE_TOKEN`
4. Set expiration (e.g. 90 days or custom)
5. Enable scopes:
   - âœ… `repo`
   - âœ… `workflow`
6. Generate and copy the token (you won't see it again)
7. Go to your forked repo: `https://github.com/YourUsername/ecal`
8. Navigate to **Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions**
9. Add a new secret:
   - Name: `TEST_SUITE_TOKEN`
   - Value: (paste the token)

### 2. `COMMIT_STATUS_TOKEN`

**Used in:** your fork of `ecal-test-suite` (e.g. `YourUsername/ecal-test-suite`)

**Purpose:**  
Sends the result of the integration test (PASS/FAIL) **back to your forked ecal repo** via commit status API.

**Type:**  
Fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT)_

**Repository access:**  
Must include your forked `ecal` repo (e.g. `YourUsername/ecal`)

**Required Repository Permissions:**

- âœ… `Read access to metadata`
- âœ… `Read and write access to commit statuses`

**How to set up:**

1. Go to [Developer Settings â†’ Personal Access Tokens â†’ Fine-grained tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens)
2. Click **"Generate new token"**
3. Repository access: choose your forked `ecal` repo
4. Permissions:
   - âœ… `Metadata: Read-only`
   - âœ… `Commit statuses: Read and write`
5. Name the token: `COMMIT_STATUS_TOKEN`
6. Generate and copy the token
7. Go to your test suite fork: `https://github.com/YourUsername/ecal-test-suite`
8. Navigate to **Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions**
9. Add a new secret:
   - Name: `COMMIT_STATUS_TOKEN`
   - Value: (paste the token)

### Note

You only need these tokens in forks or for cross-repository communication.  
If you're pushing or creating pull requests directly within the official `eclipse-ecal/ecal`, **no token setup is required**.

## Feedback to eCAL Repo

After the test run finishes, the result (pass/fail) is reported back to the Pull Request in the eCAL repository as a commit status.

## Requirements

* eCAL (If you build without Docker)
* Docker
* Python 3
* Robot Framework

## Local Development with VS Code

If you want to develop and run the tests locally in VS Code **without getting header errors (e.g. eCAL or TCLAP not found)**, we recommend using the included `.devcontainer` setup.

### Steps:

1. Make sure Docker and VS Code are installed.
2. Install the **Dev Containers extension** in VS Code.
3. Open this repository in VS Code.
4. When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"**.
5. VS Code will build and open a full-featured development environment inside Docker.

This container is based on the same Docker image used for testing, so **all dependencies like eCAL and TCLAP are pre-installed**. You can develop and run Robot Framework tests directly without needing to configure anything on your host system.

For more details, see: [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md)

## Creating New Tests

To create a new test case folder automatically, use the generator in `create_new_test/`.

See: [create_new_test/README.md](create_new_test/README.md)
